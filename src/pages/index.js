              that person who held the door so you could close your umbrella on a cold, rainy day.

              There's a japanese word for balance called Ikigai, and I try to pursuit it. I believe
              it helps us search inside ourselves and find what we can do best, even if it changes
              over time. Part of Ikigai, for me, is building magical layouts and experiences.

              If you're super curious, I mainly work with (take a deep breath) React, Redux, Gatsby,
              CSS Modules/variables and Storybook. No, none of these are Pok√©mon! As a hobby, I
              enjoy creating activities for children's literacy in Portuguese, and deeply agree with
              the Montessori method of guiding a child through the first stages of life.

              We humans grew so accustomed with smartphones, and special effects, and VR, and
              filters, and everything tech around us that we look outside searching for this "super"
              factor. But I believe in words. In acts of kindness. In building trust and empowering
              people so that they can decide by themselves. This is our "super" factor, and everyone
              can have it! Please, be a super hero too.

              There's a lot that goes behind the scenes. Of course I have some projects on my GitHub
              profile if you're curious and want to take a peek. But they're mostly outdated, and
              belong to different parts of my life and learning.

              I'm a somewhat artistic person, but deeply enjoy coding as well. I can work
              independently on my own, and feel my best by creating pages and components from
              Invision or Figma files, but will likely need guidance when some logic is more complex
              or a component requires a more complex behavior. So, what are your highs and lows?

              Professional human terms are sometimes vague, and one of the reasons is because they
              don't consider the human in his or her own integrality. I can have awesome visual
              skills, but if I'm not so good at deciphering complex logic, then I'm not that good
              after all. That's why I think that terms like Junior, Mid and Senior are, on their
              own, vague.

              Outside work, I believe school teaches us very little about how to go on with (mature)
              life. That is, before taking sides on any opinion, habit or action, one should work
              primarily on nurturing a solid moral ground - in other words, I can deeply love
              chocolate cakes, but it is unhealthy and not morally acceptable to eat them all day,
              everyday.

              Over the last few years, colleagues have told me that... + I have nice attention to
              detail! + I can communicate fairly well in English. + I don't forget to remove
              console.log statements from code reviewed requests. + I write consistent code, and try
              to slowly make a current codebase better. + I'm kinda funny and unpredictable on the
              day-to-day tasks. - I need to work on understanding Redux a bit more. - I need to
              continue working on asking for help when I reach the limits of my current knowledge.

              Humans are (kind of) social creatures, be it by quietly knowing others by reading
