  "project1Title": "Educational Resources",
  "project1Description": "Education is a delicate topic here in Brazil. Public schools are crowded and low on quality, while private schools are heavy on cost. Not only that, students often depend on guidance which doesn't always come, since both parents commonly work during the day and have no extra time to teach things and see how school studies are going, and teachers are usually too busy with book work. Homeschooling or educating oneself without a school is still a new topic, and many people and families are still afraid of it. This project aims to help spread it as another available path they can choose. It also aims to make good books, resources, communities and educational/social events known.",
