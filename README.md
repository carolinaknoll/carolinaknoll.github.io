#### :school_satchel: Welcome to carolinaknoll.github.io 
:octocat: This is where I keep my github portfolio website.  
Please note this website is currently under development.
***
##### Projects included:  
##### PSD to Code:  
– Flat-Web: One-page responsive desktop-first website based on a PSD template. Uses HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the mobile menu.  

– Insight: Also used the technologies above.   

Both of them are old and look like a little bit outdated templates, but helped me learn a lot, so I'm ready for new and more challenging templates.  

##### HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery (FreeCodeCamp projects):  
– Random Quote Generator: Online quote generator where you click a button and it gives you a random quote. Created with HTML, CSS and a little bit of jQuery.  

– Pomodoro Timer: Timer based on the Pomodoro technique. Uses HTML, CSS and jQuery.   

– JavaScript Calculator: Online calculator that allows multiple operations. Created with HTML, CSS and jQuery.    

You can check all of them by [visiting my website](http://carolinaknoll.github.io/) or exploring my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/carolinaknoll?tab=repositories).
