## :school_satchel: Welcome to carolinaknoll.github.io! :smile:
:octocat: This is where I keep my github portfolio website files.

:book: Welcome to my website repository. Here you can see how it was developed, and if you [visit the website](http://carolinaknoll.github.io/) you will be able to see links to the websites and repositories of my most current projects.

:mag: It was built the simplest way possible, with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a few JavaScript files, since it is easy to maintain it this way. I could have it updated to a React Single Page App to allow for a more organized project, but it would be a bit overkill having to update hundreds of `node_modules` dependencies only to support this simple project.

:books: That said, I do have many newer React, and a few older project apps created with `create-react-app`. I am currently in the process of specializing myself in the React, Redux, ESLint, Webpack stack.

Thank you for visiting this project! :sparkles:
