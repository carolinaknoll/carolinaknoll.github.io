#### Welcome to carolinaknoll.github.io :octocat:
:seedling: This is where I keep my github portfolio website.  
##### Projects included:  
##### – PSD to Code:  
– Flat-Web: Created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the mobile menu. Responsive with desktop-first approach.  

– Insight: Also used the technologies above. Both of them are old and look like a little bit outdated templates, but helped me learn a lot, so I'm ready for newer and more challenging templates.  

##### – HTML/CSS and JavaScript (FreeCodeCamp projects):  
– Random Quote Generator: You click a button, and it gives you a random quote. Uses HTML, CSS and a bit of jQuery.  

– Pomodoro Clock: This one was hard, because of the bigger complexity regarding jQuery. Uses HTML, CSS and jQuery.  

– JavaScript Calculator: Not so hard as the Pomodoro since I tried to keep it as simple as possible, so there is a lot of repetitive code. I like the visual result of it. Using HTML, CSS and jQuery.  

You can check all of them by [visiting my website](carolinaknoll.github.io) or exploring my [Projects GitHub Repository](https://github.com/carolinaknoll/projects).
